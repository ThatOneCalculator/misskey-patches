# misskey-patches
The patches used on https://stop.voring.me

- Favicon/icon
- Default menu items
- Default theme
- Default emojis
- Turn off new note sound
- Search syntax URL
- Images (error/info/unknown user)

### Usage:
```
cd misskey
git clone https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/misskey-patches/ patches
chmod +x ./patches/make.sh
./patches/make.sh
```

I also add the [Ros√© Pine for Misskey](https://github.com/rose-pine/misskey) themes seperately, given they don't need to be re-added every change.
